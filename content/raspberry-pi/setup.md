####  Step 1: Install Raspbian

Use the [official](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) docs to help you install Raspbian. But it's more than likely that your Pi already has a boot image on the SD card that came with it. So, power it up and see if you get something like below:

####  Step 2: Configure Raspbian

Once booted up and on the desktop of Raspbian, we need to set the Locale, Timezone, Keyboard and enable SSH.

- click on the Raspberry Pi menu icon
- Select **Preferences**, **Raspberry Pi Configuration**
- In the **Raspberry Pi Configuration**, on the **Interfaces** tab
- Next to **SSH**, select **enable**, click **OK**
- In **Raspberry Pi Configuration**, on the **Localisation** tab, click **Set Locale**
- Select the Language (eg en), Country (eg CA) and leave Character Set at UTF-8, click **OK**
- In **Raspberry Pi Configuration**, on the **Localisation** tab, click **Set Timezone**
- Select the Area (eg Canada), Location (eg Eastern), click **OK**
- In **Raspberry Pi Configuration**, on the **Localisation** tab, click **Set Keyboard**
- Select the Country, Variant and click **OK**
- In **Raspberry Pi Configuration**, click **OK**, and reboot

####  Step 2: Updates

In the terminal run the following commands, each one after the other has finished:

- `sudo apt-get update -y`
- `sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
- `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y`
- `sudo apt-get autoremove -y`

####  Step 3: Dashboard Dependencies

In the terminal run the following commands, each one after the other has finished:

- `sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser`
- `sudo apt-get install -y ttf-mscorefonts-installer`
- `sudo apt-get install -y unclutter`
- `sudo apt-get install -y x11-xserver-utils`

This will install everything you need to get a fullscreen dashboard running

####  Step 4: Boot Setup

We need to configure the PI to boot straight to the dashboard. You will need the IP of the server running the dashboard.

`sudo vi .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`

Comment out the following line: *(Put a # before it)*
``` bash
@xscreensaver -no-splash
```

Add the following to the bottom of the file: *(replace http://192.168.0.1 with your server IP)*

``` bash
@/usr/bin/chromium-browser --incognito --start-maximized --kiosk http://192.168.0.1
@unclutter
@xset s off
@xset s noblank
@xset -dpms
```


#### Step 5: SSH

Open the terminal and find the Pi's IP address: `ifconfig`. Make sure you are connected to your network first. Note down the IP.

Connect to your PI from another machine: *(replace 192.168.0.10 with actual IP)*

`ssh pi@192.168.0.10`

Most of the time the user is set to `pi` and the default password is `raspberry`. You will probably want change this. You can do that with `passwd`.

#### Step 4: Reboot

You should now be able to reboot the PI and watch it boot straight to a browser, go fullscreen and load your dashboard from your server. You can do the above for as many PI's as you like.
